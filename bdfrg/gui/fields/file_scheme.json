  "tooltip": "Pattern for each downloaded file name. The scheme format takes the form of {KEY}, where KEY is a string from the below list:\n\nDATE, FLAIR, POSTID, REDDITOR, SUBREDDIT, TITLE, UPVOTES\n\nEach of these can be enclosed in curly bracket, {}, and included in the name. For example, to just title every downloaded post with the unique submission ID, you can use {POSTID}. Static strings can also be included, such as 'download_' in 'download_{POSTID}'. The previous string will result in the following submission file names:\n\n    download_aaaaaa.png\n    download_bbbbbb.png\n\nAt least one key must be included, otherwise an error will be thrown.It is highly recommended that the file name scheme contain the parameter {POSTID} as this is the only parameter guaranteed to be unique."
