# Bulk Downloader For Reddit GUI

This is a simple program that provides a GUI to the [Bulk Downloader For Reddit](https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit) program.
BDFR is a program that allows you to download all the images from a subreddit, user, or multireddit. It can also download all the comments from a subreddit, user, or multireddit.
It does not feature any GUI, so this program was created to make it easier to use.

## Usage
Right now simply start the configuration_gui.py file and configure the settings. A live preview of the assembled startup command will be shown at the bottom.
Each field comes with a tooltip that explains what it does (most are taken from the docs of BDFR). If you have any further questions, look up the docs for BDFR.

## Future plans
I plan to add a way to save the settings to a file, so you don't have to reconfigure everything every time you want to download something.
I also plan to add support for launching the program from the GUI alongside monitoring the progress of the download.
Furthermore, I plan on improving the GUI itself, as it is currently very basic. This includes a file explorer to select the download location, possibly auto-fill for popular reddit user-names and subreddits.
An option for copy-pasting a link and automatically filling in the fields would also be nice.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and make a pull request. I will review it and merge it if it is good.
